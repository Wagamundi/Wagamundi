## Hi
I really don't know what to write here...
So I promise you that I will for sure write something here, sometimes.

## For now:
I'm just a young hobby dev from Germany.<br>
My main language is Rust currently, I don't know if I am good at it tho.<br>
I'm also using JS, HTML, CSS (ye I know HTML and CSS don't count),I'v written something in Java, C# and Visual Basic (Who uses that fr) and Python.
